The code from the .bl file can be copy and pasted into Bricklayer environment, 
and adjusted as desired.

The function property x is checking to see if the x value is divisible by 3 
(with a remainder of 0) and if it is then it will make all values with that x 
coordinate black. If the remainder is anything other than 0 then it will make it
red. 

The stripes are restricted to the (12,1,20) region.
